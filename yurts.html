            </strong>
            <dd>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt has<br />
              canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and
              a private deck.
            </dd>
            <strong>
              <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            </strong>
            <dd>
              Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with
              down quilt, comfy<br />
              couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee
              maker. Your<br />
              luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold
              running water.<br />
              Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            </strong>
            <dd>
              Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
              changing<br />
              weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring
              a flashlight and a<br />
              sense of adventure!
